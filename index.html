<p> Hi I'm Vandana Anand, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I wanted to be a CS major ever since junior year of high school after taking a Java class. I enjoy web development and design. In addition to CS, I love to travel, bake, and sing. </p>

<p>I am currently taking an HCI class in which I learned a lot of different design principles by applying them in various, interesting projects. Below are some of the projects and the corresponding design document my teams and I made using Medium. </p>
